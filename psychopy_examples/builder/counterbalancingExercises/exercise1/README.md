Are you a dog or a cat person? A Simple Reaction Time task
==========================================================

In this exercise you will see a simple experiment that has been designed to test if the participant is a dog or a cat person (which set of images to they respond fastest to). The researcher has made a block design, so that all participants see cats followed by dogs. Now, we don't want this. Your goal is to improve the flexibility of this design in 2 steps. 

Step 1: Randomised Block Designs
--------------------------------
It might be that we just want the order (Cat -> Dog or Dog -> Cat) to be in a random order. This is a "Randomised Block Design". As a first step follow what we have learnt so far to implement a randomised block design.

Hint: You will need three excel/csv files, one for the cat conditions, one for the dog conditions and one for all conditions


Step 2: Counterbalanced design
--------------------------------
In many cases we want to balance the number of participants exposed to each condition first - this is known as counterbalancing. Extend your randomised block design to a counterbalanced design.

Hint: You will need an excel/csv file per group, and you will need to add a "group" parameter to the experiment info dialogue box presented at the start of your experiment.
